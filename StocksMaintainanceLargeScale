Suppose you maintain stock exchanges of around 10,000 companies  [open/ high/low/closing]

You need to monitor these at end of the day

Feed is delivered once per trading day in CSV

Solution:

Store in text file/ database or XML
If you keep data in text files:
    Difficult to manage and update
    Hard to query
    Keeping unorganized text files - inefficient data model

Use DB:
  Logical storage of data
  An easy way of doing 'query processing'
  Easy to maintain
  Roll back, back up and secusity is easy
