# I was working for a Product based company a few months ago.
# I was dealing witha records management client based in Jamaica and I implemented a EDRMS Automated solution for them

This problem is not about the solution that I implemented but a general warehouse probem which every warehouse company might be facing. 
I thought of making an algorithm with which they can place the records/ invesntory using the minimum racks


If suppose we have n items to be placed in inventory boxes or n records to be placed on racks in warehouse
and we want to place them with least number of racks or boxes possible. What do we do?
Ofcourse if w have items around 10 or 20 we can manually calculate. But with bigb companies items are numerous.

For understanding the problem in etter way, refer to my blog

Lets design algorithm.

 int countOFBox=1;
        int spaceInBox = size;
        for(int i=0; i<numberOfItems; i++)
        {
            if(spaceInBox - arrayOfItem[i] > 0)
            {
                spaceInBox -= arrayOfItem[i];
                continue;
            }
            else
            {
                countOFBox++;
                spaceInBox = size;
                i--;
            }
        }
