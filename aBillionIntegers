Suppose we have a input file around 8 billion integers
We need to check which integer is not resent in file, efficiently

MEmory Constraint :  1 GB memory


Algorithm:
We have 16 billion bits
MAp all the integers possible

Create bitb vector of 8 billion size
Initialize BV with all zeroes
Scan, put BV[index] =1 if Inteegr found
Scan again to find first zero

byte[] sample =new byte[0xFFFFFF/16];

Scanner inRead= new Scanner(new FileReader("abc.txt"));
while(inRead.hasNextInt())
{
  int x=inRead.nextInt();
  sample[n/16]=1 <<(n%16);
}

And following up with that,

Scan and return zero ones
